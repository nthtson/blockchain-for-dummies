What is a blockchain?
################################################################################

A Blockchain is a kind of database: while a normal database is located on a server, a blockchain is distributed among the software users.
For example, the Facebook’s database is located on a protected server and no one can access the information. The Bitcoin’s blockchain instead is located on servers and computers (called nodes) of all the Bitcoin users.

All the transactions that occur between ewallets are stored on the bitcoin’s blockchain. All the servers and the computers that are using bitcoin have the same copy of the blockchain stored on their hard disk.

There are many kinds of blockchain with different features, like Ethereum, Hyperledger, Ripple. Some of them are more suitable to handle currency, others are used to transfer the ownership of assets (eg supply chain).

You don’t need to download all the blockchain to your computer in order to use Bitcoin (or any other blockchain technology) as the current size of Bitcoin’s blockchain is over 160 GB and it can easily drain the resources of your computer. To avoid this issue there are different types of e-wallets (we will talk about them later).
